# Optimal Dataset Strategy & Scope Handling Architecture

## Executive Summary

Based on your 7 core entities and 3 scope types (Time/Sprint/Release), the optimal strategy is **4 Strategic Datasets + Smart Scope Abstraction Layer** to balance performance, maintainability, and UX complexity.

---

## 1. Dataset Strategy Analysis

### **Current Entity Relationships:**
```
Test Case ←→ Requirement (M:M)
Test Case → Test Result → Test Run (1:M:1)
Test Result ←→ Defect (M:M)  
Test Run → Configuration (M:1)
All entities → Release/Sprint (scoping)
```

### **Performance vs Complexity Matrix:**

| **Strategy** | **Query Performance** | **Maintenance** | **Scope Complexity** | **Recommendation** |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **7 Separate Datasets** | ❌ Poor (complex JOINs) | ✅ Simple | ❌ Complex | ❌ Not recommended |
| **15+ Pre-joined Views** | ✅ Excellent | ❌ Complex | ✅ Simple | ❌ Too complex to maintain |
| **4 Strategic Datasets** | ✅ Good | ✅ Manageable | ✅ Abstracted | ✅ **RECOMMENDED** |

## 2. Recommended Dataset Architecture

### **Dataset 1: Test Execution Analysis** 
*Primary for performance, quality, and operational metrics*

```sql
-- Core entity: Test Results with key relationships
SELECT 
  tr.id as result_id,
  tr.start_time, tr.end_time, tr.duration, tr.status,
  tc.id as test_case_id, tc.name, tc.type as test_type,
  trun.id as run_id, trun.executor, trun.execution_method,
  config.os, config.browser, config.environment,
  -- Scope fields (critical for filtering)
  trun.release_id, trun.sprint_id,
  -- Pre-calculated metrics
  CASE WHEN tr.status IN ('Passed') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as is_passed,
  CASE WHEN tr.status IN ('Failed','Error') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as is_failed
FROM test_results tr
JOIN test_cases tc ON tr.test_case_id = tc.id  
JOIN test_runs trun ON tr.test_run_id = trun.id
JOIN configurations config ON trun.configuration_id = config.id
WHERE tc.status = 'Published' -- Only published test cases
```

**Use Cases Served:**
- Test execution trends (80% of widgets)
- Performance analysis 
- Quality metrics
- Configuration coverage
- Automation ROI analysis

### **Dataset 2: Requirement Coverage Analysis**
*Primary for coverage, planning, and release readiness*

```sql
-- Core entity: Requirements with test case relationships  
SELECT 
  req.id as requirement_id, req.title, req.status,
  req.release_id, req.sprint_id,
  tc.id as test_case_id, tc.status as test_case_status, tc.type,
  -- Coverage calculations
  CASE WHEN tc.status = 'Published' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as has_published_test,
  -- Latest execution status per requirement-testcase
  latest_result.status as latest_execution_status,
  latest_result.start_time as last_executed_date
FROM requirements req
LEFT JOIN test_case_requirements tcr ON req.id = tcr.requirement_id
LEFT JOIN test_cases tc ON tcr.test_case_id = tc.id
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT status, start_time 
  FROM test_results tr 
  WHERE tr.test_case_id = tc.id 
  ORDER BY start_time DESC LIMIT 1
) latest_result ON true
```

**Use Cases Served:**
- Requirement coverage tracking
- Test planning
- Release readiness assessment
- Gap analysis

### **Dataset 3: Defect Analysis**
*Primary for quality issues and resolution tracking*

```sql
-- Core entity: Defects with context relationships
SELECT 
  d.id as defect_id, d.title, d.severity, d.priority, d.status,
  d.created_date, d.resolved_date, d.assignee,
  d.release_id, d.sprint_id,
  -- Related test context
  tr.test_case_id, tc.name as test_case_name,
  trun.id as test_run_id, trun.executor,
  -- Related requirement context  
  req.id as requirement_id, req.title as requirement_title,
  -- Calculated fields
  CASE WHEN d.resolved_date IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as is_open,
  CASE WHEN d.priority IN ('Critical','High') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as is_blocking
FROM defects d
LEFT JOIN test_result_defects trd ON d.id = trd.defect_id
LEFT JOIN test_results tr ON trd.test_result_id = tr.id  
LEFT JOIN test_cases tc ON tr.test_case_id = tc.id

- Resolution time tracking
- Quality assessment
- Blocking issues identification

### **Dataset 4: Test Case Management**
*Primary for test case activity and maintenance*

```sql
-- Core entity: Test Cases with activity and relationships
SELECT 
  tc.id as test_case_id, tc.name, tc.status, tc.type, 
  tc.author, tc.created_date, tc.updated_date,
  -- Requirements relationship
  COUNT(DISTINCT tcr.requirement_id) as linked_requirements,
  -- Execution summary (last 30 days)
  COUNT(DISTINCT tr.id) as recent_executions,
  MAX(tr.start_time) as last_executed,
  -- Scope inference from executions and requirements
  COALESCE(req_release.release_id, exec_release.release_id) as inferred_release_id,
  COALESCE(req_sprint.sprint_id, exec_sprint.sprint_id) as inferred_sprint_id
FROM test_cases tc
LEFT JOIN test_case_requirements tcr ON tc.id = tcr.test_case_id
LEFT JOIN requirements req ON tcr.requirement_id = req.id
LEFT JOIN test_results tr ON tc.id = tr.test_case_id 
  AND tr.start_time >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
LEFT JOIN test_runs trun ON tr.test_run_id = trun.id
-- Get release/sprint from requirements
LEFT JOIN (SELECT test_case_id, release_id FROM test_case_requirements tcr2 
           JOIN requirements r ON tcr2.requirement_id = r.id) req_release 
           ON tc.id = req_release.test_case_id
-- Get release/sprint from executions  
LEFT JOIN (SELECT test_case_id, release_id FROM test_results tr2
           JOIN test_runs trun2 ON tr2.test_run_id = trun2.id) exec_release
           ON tc.id = exec_release.test_case_id
GROUP BY tc.id, [other fields]
```

**Use Cases Served:**
- Test case activity tracking
- Author productivity analysis
- Test maintenance workflows
- Automation transition tracking

## 3. Scope Handling Architecture

### **The Challenge:**
Same business question, different technical implementations:

```
Business: "Show me pass rate for Sprint 7"

Time Scope: WHERE tr.start_time BETWEEN '2024-03-01' AND '2024-03-31'
Sprint Scope: WHERE trun.sprint_id = 'sprint_7_id'  
Release Scope: WHERE trun.release_id = 'release_2_id'
All: No additional filters
```

### **Solution: Smart Scope Abstraction Layer**

```typescript
interface ScopeConfig {
  type: 'time' | 'sprint' | 'release' | 'all';
  value: string | DateRange;
  label: string; // "Sprint 7", "Last 30 days", "Release 2.1"
}

class ScopeHandler {
  generateFilters(scope: ScopeConfig, dataset: string): SupersetFilter[] {
    switch (scope.type) {
      case 'time':
        return [{
          col: this.getTimeColumn(dataset), // start_time, created_date, etc.
          op: 'TEMPORAL_RANGE',
          val: scope.value
        }];
        
      case 'sprint':
        return [
          { col: 'sprint_id', op: '==', val: scope.value },
          // Include out-of-sprint executions for completeness
          { col: 'start_time', op: 'TEMPORAL_RANGE', val: this.getSprintBoundaries(scope.value) }
        ];
        
      case 'release':
        return [
          { col: 'release_id', op: '==', val: scope.value },
          // Additional logic for release boundaries
        ];
        
      case 'all':
        return []; // No additional filters
    }
  }
}
```

### **Dataset-Specific Scope Implementation:**

| **Dataset** | **Time Scope** | **Sprint Scope** | **Release Scope** | **All Scope** |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Test Execution** | `start_time` filter | `sprint_id` filter + date bounds | `release_id` filter | No filter |
| **Requirements** | `updated_date` filter | Direct `sprint_id` | Direct `release_id` | No filter |
| **Defects** | `created_date` filter | `sprint_id` + linked execution scope | `release_id` + linked execution scope | No filter |
| **Test Cases** | `updated_date` filter | Inferred from executions/requirements | Inferred from executions/requirements | No filter |

---

## 4. Performance Optimization Strategy

### **Caching by Scope Type:**

```
Time-based queries: Cache for 5 minutes (frequent changes)
Sprint-based queries: Cache for 1 hour (stable within sprint)  
Release-based queries: Cache for 4 hours (very stable)
All-scope queries: Cache for 30 minutes (large dataset)
```

### **Pre-aggregation Strategy:**

```sql
-- Create materialized views for common metrics by scope
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sprint_metrics_cache AS
SELECT 
  sprint_id,
  date_trunc('day', start_time) as execution_date,
  COUNT(*) as total_executions,
  SUM(is_passed) as passed_executions,  
  AVG(duration) as avg_duration,
  COUNT(DISTINCT test_case_id) as unique_tests
FROM test_execution_dataset 
WHERE sprint_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY sprint_id, execution_date;

-- Refresh every 15 minutes during active sprints
```

### **Query Performance by Use Case:**

| **Use Case** | **Expected Data Volume** | **Query Complexity** | **Cache Strategy** | **Performance Target** |
|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Sprint Dashboard** | 1,000-5,000 executions | Medium (1-2 JOINs) | 1 hour cache | < 2 seconds |
| **Time Trends** | 10,000-50,000 executions | Low (aggregation) | 5 minute cache | < 3 seconds |
| **Coverage Analysis** | 100-1,000 requirements | High (complex logic) | 1 hour cache | < 5 seconds |
| **Cross-Project** | 100,000+ executions | High (large dataset) | 4 hour cache | < 10 seconds |

---

## 6. Scope UX Design Patterns

### **Single Scope Selector (Recommended)**
```
[Scope Type Dropdown: Time ▼]  [Scope Value: Last 30 days ▼]

When user changes to "Sprint":
[Scope Type Dropdown: Sprint ▼]  [Scope Value: Sprint 7 (Active) ▼]
```

### **Context-Aware Defaults:**
```
Dashboard Context → Default Scope
Release Dashboard → Release scope with current release
Sprint Retrospective → Sprint scope with completed sprint
Performance Review → Time scope with last quarter
Ad-hoc Analysis → Time scope with last 30 days
```

### **Scope Persistence Strategy:**
```typescript
// Store user's last scope choice per context
interface UserScopePreference {
  userId: string;
  context: 'dashboard' | 'reports' | 'analysis';
  lastScope: ScopeConfig;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// Auto-apply user's typical scope for context
// but allow easy switching with memory
```

## 7. Technical Validation

### **Query Complexity Comparison:**

```sql
-- BEFORE: Complex join query every time
SELECT 
  AVG(duration),
  COUNT(*) as total_tests
FROM test_results tr
JOIN test_cases tc ON tr.test_case_id = tc.id
JOIN test_runs trun ON tr.test_run_id = trun.id  
JOIN configurations c ON trun.configuration_id = c.id
WHERE trun.sprint_id = 'sprint_7'
  AND tc.status = 'Published'
  AND tr.start_time >= '2024-03-01'
  AND tr.start_time < '2024-04-01';

-- AFTER: Simple query on optimized dataset
SELECT 
  AVG(duration),
  COUNT(*) as total_tests  
FROM test_execution_dataset
WHERE sprint_id = 'sprint_7';
```

**Performance Improvement:** ~10x faster queries, ~5x less database load

### **Scope Handling Validation:**

```
Business Question: "Sprint 7 pass rate"

Old Approach: 
❌ User constructs complex filters
❌ Multiple dataset selections required  
❌ Easy to get wrong results

New Approach:
✅ Select "Sprint 7" from dropdown
✅ System generates optimal query automatically
✅ Consistent results across all widgets
```

This architecture provides the optimal balance of performance, maintainability, and user experience while fully leveraging Superset's capabilities behind a business-friendly interface.
