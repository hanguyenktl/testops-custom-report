## **Phase 1 Detailed Breakdown (Your 2-Month Focus)**

### **Critical Success Factors for Phase 1:**

1. **Business Logic Translation (64 points)** - The core innovation
   - Metrics Translation Layer: Convert "Test Pass Rate" → SQL aggregations
   - Filter Abstraction: "Last 30 days" → date range queries
   - Scope Management: Handle Time/Sprint/Release context switching

2. **Widget Creation Engine (55 points)** - User-facing experience
   - Use Case Templates: Performance, Quality, Productivity templates
   - Progressive Configuration: Step-by-step guided creation
   - Live Preview System: Real-time chart updates during configuration

3. **Execution Dataset (71 points)** - Data foundation
   - Schema Design: Business-friendly field names and structure
   - Data Transformation: ETL for clean business data presentation
   - Mock Data Generation: Realistic test data for development

### **Risk Mitigation:**

- **High Complexity Items**: 
  - Scope Management (25 points) - Never done before, critical for UX
  - Live Preview System (21 points) - Complex real-time updates
  - Progressive Configuration (21 points) - Context-aware UI logic

- **Dependencies**:
  - Superset API integration must be stable before widget creation testing
  - Mock data system needed early for development and demos
  - Template system architecture affects all widget types

### **Assumptions:**
- Using mock data initially (real Superset integration in Phase 2)
- Focus on execution dataset only (other datasets in Phase 2)
- Template-driven approach to reduce complexity
- Leveraging existing Katalon UI patterns where possible
- Current team velocity of 30 points/sprint maintained
